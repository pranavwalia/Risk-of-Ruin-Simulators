# Risk of Ruin Simulators
 This project is a set of functions that allow for the simulation and vizulations of Risk of Ruin in two player games of chance. Two players can be given variable amounts of capital, and assigned their own probabilities of winning a bet. The simulator will then run the betting experiment to determine Risk of Ruin for both players based on the amount of money in play.

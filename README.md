# Risk of Ruin Simulators

I created this repository for the priamry purpose of simulating and demonstrating how risk of ruin interacts with a variety of betting/investment games based on expected value. In particular, various modules allow for a Data Scientist to study the behavior of risk in different situations. 

The included modules are as follows:
* Kelly Criteron Simulator: Demonstrates how Kelly betting strategy optimized portfolio growth
* Coin toss experiment: Demonstrates the effect of capital advantage in a fair betting game.
* Toy Game Simulator: Custom probability based betting with custom portfolio sizes to model risk for individual players
